    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Shahi paneer is a popular North Indian dish that is rich, creamy, and full of flavor. To make shahi paneer, start
        by heating some oil in a pan and adding some cumin seeds, bay leaves, and cloves. Next, add some finely chopped
        onions and sauté them until they turn golden brown. Then, add some ginger-garlic paste and cook for a minute or
        two. Add some tomato puree, along with some salt, red chili powder, coriander powder, and garam masala, and cook
        until the tomato puree thickens and the oil separates. Add some paneer cubes and cook for a few minutes.
        Finally, add some cream and kasuri methi and simmer for a couple of minutes. Serve hot with naan, roti, or rice.
