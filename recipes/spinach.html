    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Linguine with spinach, egg, and pancetta is a flavorful dish that combines pasta with the richness of egg and the
        saltiness of pancetta.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Linguine pasta - 1 pound</li>
        <li>Pancetta - 6 ounces (diced)</li>
        <li>Garlic - 3 cloves (minced)</li>
        <li>Spinach - 6 ounces (roughly chopped)</li>
        <li>Eggs - 2 large</li>
        <li>Heavy cream - 1/2 cup</li>
        <li>Grated Parmesan cheese - 1/2 cup</li>
        <li>Salt - to taste</li>
        <li>Black pepper - to taste</li>
        <li>Red pepper flakes - optional, for spice</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the linguine and cook until al dente, according to package
            instructions. Reserve 1/2 cup of pasta water before draining the linguine.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, cook the pancetta over medium heat until crispy, stirring occasionally. Add minced
            garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add the roughly chopped spinach to the skillet and cook until wilted, about 2-3 minutes. Season with salt
            and black pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, whisk together 2 eggs, heavy cream, and grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Add the cooked linguine and reserved pasta water to the skillet with the spinach and pancetta. Toss
            everything together to combine.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low and pour the egg and cream mixture over the linguine. Toss everything together
            quickly, using tongs, until the sauce thickens and coats the linguine. Be careful not to scramble the eggs.
        </li>
        <li>Remove the skillet from heat and sprinkle red pepper flakes, if using, over the linguine. Toss everything
            together one more time.</li>
        <li>Divide the linguine among bowls and serve hot. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
